## 🧩 Vercel v0 Usage

## ✨ Improvements Made to v0 Design

Compared to the original Vercel v0 output (reference link below), multiple refinements were made:

- The **testimonials layout** was incorrectly aligned and was fixed for consistent responsiveness.
- The original **color palette was monotone (blue & white)** — a refined design system was introduced with enhanced contrast.
- **Spacing between components** was optimized to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
- Integrated **ShadCN UI** to add a **dark theme** with blue as the primary color, expanding the visual palette.
- To break flat backgrounds, custom abstract images were generated using **Hakei** and incorporated into sections.
- The **header and footer layouts** remained the same as the original design for structure consistency.
